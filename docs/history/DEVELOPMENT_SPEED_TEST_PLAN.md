# Development Speed Comparison Test Plan: Claude Code vs Sagitta Code

## Objective
Compare the development speed and efficiency of Claude Code versus Sagitta Code when implementing new features in a well-known Rust library, leveraging Sagitta's indexing and semantic search capabilities.

## Test Prompt (Copy and Paste This)

```
I'm in a fresh clone of the regex repository (https://github.com/rust-lang/regex). I want to add a CLI tool to this crate. Please help me build a command-line interface with the following features:

1. `regex test <pattern> <file>` - Test a regex pattern against a file and show all matches
2. `regex validate <pattern>` - Validate if a regex pattern is valid and explain what it does
3. `regex replace <pattern> <replacement> <file>` - Find and replace using regex
4. `regex benchmark <pattern> <file>` - Benchmark regex performance on a file

Requirements:
- Create the CLI as a new binary in the regex crate (add to Cargo.toml)
- Use the `clap` crate for CLI parsing
- Add proper error handling with helpful messages
- Include colored output for matches
- Add a --help for each subcommand
- Create integration tests for each command
- Follow the regex crate's existing code style and conventions

Start by exploring the regex crate's structure and API, then implement the CLI tool.
```

## Test Library Selection
**Recommended Library:** `serde_json` or `clap`
- Well-documented, widely used Rust libraries
- Complex enough to benefit from semantic search
- Clear API patterns to follow

## Test Scenarios

### Primary Scenario: Add a CLI to an Existing Library
**Target Libraries:** `regex`, `toml`, or `reqwest`
- Libraries that would benefit from a CLI tool
- Have clear APIs but no existing CLI interface
- Complex enough to showcase search advantages

#### Example: Add CLI to `regex` crate
**Task:** Create a command-line interface for the regex crate with features like:
- Pattern testing against input files
- Regex validation and explanation
- Performance benchmarking
- Find and replace operations

**Subtasks:**
1. Understand the library's public API
2. Find example usage patterns in tests/docs
3. Design CLI structure using clap/structopt
4. Implement core commands:
   - `regex test <pattern> <file>`
   - `regex validate <pattern>`
   - `regex replace <pattern> <replacement> <file>`
   - `regex benchmark <pattern> <file>`
5. Add error handling and user feedback
6. Create integration tests
7. Write documentation and examples

**Metrics to Track:**
- Time to understand API surface
- Efficiency in finding usage examples
- Number of modules explored
- Time to implement each command
- Quality of error handling

### Alternative Scenario: Add CLI to `toml` crate
**Task:** Build a TOML manipulation CLI tool

**Features:**
- Validate TOML files
- Query values using dot notation
- Merge multiple TOML files
- Convert between TOML and JSON
- Pretty-print and format

**Key Challenges:**
- Understanding parser internals
- Finding serialization patterns
- Implementing path-based queries
- Error reporting and recovery

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Setup (Both Tools)
1. Clone the target repository
2. Set up development environment
3. Run existing tests to ensure baseline

### Phase 2: Claude Code Development
1. Use standard file navigation (ls, grep, find)
2. Read files sequentially to understand patterns
3. Implement feature using discovered patterns
4. Document time and steps taken

### Phase 3: Sagitta Code Development
1. Add repository to Sagitta index
2. Use semantic search to find:
   - Similar implementations
   - Relevant patterns
   - Test examples
3. Implement feature using indexed knowledge
4. Document time and queries used

## Comparison Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Total development time** (minutes)
- **Time to first relevant code** (minutes)
- **Number of files opened/read**
- **Number of search operations**
- **False positive rate** (irrelevant results)
- **Implementation iterations needed**

### Qualitative Metrics
- **Code quality** (following existing patterns)
- **Completeness** (edge cases handled)
- **Test coverage**
- **Documentation quality**
- **Developer confidence** (1-10 scale)

## Expected Advantages of Sagitta Code

### Semantic Search Benefits for CLI Development
- **API Discovery**: "Find all public methods in the regex crate" vs manual exploration
- **Usage Examples**: "Show me how to compile and match patterns" from tests/examples
- **Error Handling**: "Find all error types and handling patterns"
- **Builder Patterns**: "Show me builder pattern implementations" for CLI design

### Indexing Benefits
- **Instant Navigation**: Jump to API definitions without searching
- **Cross-crate Understanding**: See how regex is used in other CLIs
- **Type-aware Search**: Find all methods that return Result types
- **Example Mining**: Quickly find test cases demonstrating API usage

## Test Execution Instructions

### Setup for Both Tests:
```bash
# Clone fresh copy for each test
git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/regex.git regex-claude
git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/regex.git regex-sagitta
```

### For Claude Code Test:
1. `cd regex-claude`
2. Start fresh terminal session
3. Start timer
4. Copy and paste the test prompt above
5. Use standard Claude Code features (no Sagitta MCP tools)
6. Document time for each subtask
7. Commit changes to track what was added

### For Sagitta Code Test:
1. `cd regex-sagitta`
2. Start fresh terminal session
3. Start timer
4. Copy and paste the test prompt above
5. Use Sagitta MCP tools actively:
   - Add regex repository for indexing
   - Use semantic search for API discovery
   - Query for usage patterns and examples
6. Document time for each subtask and queries used
7. Commit changes to track what was added

### Measurement Points:
- Time to understand regex API
- Time to find usage examples
- Time to implement first command
- Time to add error handling
- Time to complete all features
- Total development time

## Test Execution Plan

### Day 1: Preparation
- Clone two fresh copies of regex repository (regex-claude and regex-sagitta)
- Verify both build successfully with `cargo build`
- Set up measurement spreadsheet
- Prepare screen recording tools

### Day 2: Claude Code Implementation
- Use test prompt above
- Record screen for analysis
- Document each step taken
- Note pain points and delays

### Day 3: Sagitta Code Implementation
- Use test prompt above
- Record screen for analysis
- Document semantic queries used
- Note efficiency gains

### Day 4: Analysis
- Compare metrics
- Identify specific scenarios where each tool excels
- Document recommendations

## Success Criteria

Sagitta Code should demonstrate:
- **30-50% reduction** in time to find relevant code
- **Fewer false positives** in search results
- **Better pattern discovery** for similar implementations
- **Reduced context switching** between files
- **Faster API understanding** through semantic queries

## Specific CLI Development Advantages

Where Sagitta should excel:
1. **Finding API usage patterns**: "How is Regex::new used with error handling?"
2. **Discovering test examples**: "Show me all tests that use captures"
3. **Understanding module structure**: "What are the main components of this crate?"
4. **Cross-referencing features**: "Find all methods that work with capture groups"

## Additional Test Scenarios (Optional)

1. **Library Comparison**: Add CLI to different library types (parser vs client vs data structure)
2. **Feature Extension**: Add advanced CLI features like interactive mode or config files
3. **Integration Scenario**: Make the CLI work with multiple related crates

## Deliverables

1. **Detailed time logs** for both approaches
2. **Search query comparison** (grep/find vs semantic)
3. **Code quality assessment**
4. **Video recordings** of both sessions
5. **Final recommendation report**
6. **Two git repositories** with CLI implementations:
   - `regex-claude/` - Implementation using Claude Code
   - `regex-sagitta/` - Implementation using Sagitta Code
7. **Git commit history** showing development progression

## Notes

- Ensure fresh start for each tool (no prior knowledge)
- Use same developer for both tests to eliminate skill variance
- Consider running multiple iterations with different features
- Document unexpected discoveries or tool limitations
