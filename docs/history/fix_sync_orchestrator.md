# Fix for Auto-Sync Repository Functionality

## Issues Identified

1. **Sync orchestrator not started properly**: The `start()` method was not being called before using the sync orchestrator.
2. **Repository initialization order**: Repositories were only being added to the sync orchestrator if both file watcher AND auto-commit were enabled.
3. **Missing notifications**: The sync notifications weren't being triggered because the sync orchestrator wasn't properly started.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Sync Orchestrator Initialization (`src/gui/app.rs`)

**Problem**: The sync orchestrator was created but its `start()` method was never called, meaning the background tasks for processing sync events were never started.

**Fix**: Added explicit call to `sync_orchestrator.start().await?` before storing the orchestrator:

```rust
// Start the sync orchestrator BEFORE doing anything else - this is critical!
let _sync_result_rx = sync_orchestrator.start().await?;
log::info!("Sync orchestrator started successfully");
```

### 2. Fixed Repository Addition Logic

**Problem**: Repositories were only being added to the sync orchestrator if both file watcher AND auto-commit were enabled. This meant that repository switching and auto-sync wouldn't work if either feature was disabled.

**Fix**: Moved the repository addition logic outside the conditional block so it always runs:

```rust
// Always add existing repositories to sync orchestrator, regardless of file watcher/auto-commit settings
let repo_manager_clone = repo_manager.clone();
let sync_orchestrator_clone = sync_orchestrator.clone();
tokio::spawn(async move {
    // ... repository addition logic ...
});
```

### 3. Added Comprehensive Test Suite

Created `src/services/sync_orchestrator_test.rs` with tests for:
- Sync orchestrator initialization
- Repository addition and status tracking
- Repository switching with notifications
- File watcher integration
- Sync notification content validation

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Repository Addition**: When a repository is added via the UI, it should be automatically added to the sync orchestrator and trigger an initial sync with notification.

2. **Repository Switching**: When switching repositories via the dropdown, it should trigger a sync notification showing the repository status.

3. **File Changes**: When files are modified (if file watcher is enabled), the repository should be marked as out-of-sync and eventually synced.

4. **Notifications**: All sync operations should show slide-out notifications in the top-right corner with:
   - Success: "Repository synced successfully" 
   - Info: "Local repository indexed successfully" (for local-only repos)
   - Warning: "Authentication failed - check SSH keys. Local indexing succeeded."
   - Error: Sync error messages

## Testing the Fix

1. Start the application
2. Add a repository or switch between repositories
3. Check for sync notifications in the top-right corner
4. Monitor logs for sync orchestrator initialization and activity
5. Verify that repository status is properly tracked

## Configuration Requirements

For full functionality, ensure in your configuration:

```json
{
  "auto_sync": {
    "enabled": true,
    "sync_on_repo_switch": true,
    "sync_on_repo_add": true,
    "sync_after_commit": true,
    "file_watcher": {
      "enabled": true,
      "debounce_ms": 2000
    }
  }
}
```

The sync orchestrator will work with minimal functionality even if file watcher or auto-commit are disabled, but full auto-sync requires all features enabled.
