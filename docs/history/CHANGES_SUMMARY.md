# Summary of Changes Made

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Semantic Search Results Click Functionality
- **Issue**: Could hover over search results but clicking didn't work
- **Fix**: Added break statement in render_search_output to properly propagate click actions
- **Implementation**: Modified `/home/adam/repos/sagitta/crates/sagitta-code/src/gui/chat/view.rs` to ensure action is returned when search result is clicked

### 2. Shell Execution Tool Height Issues
- **Issue**: Shell output was too small vertically and would shrink during streaming
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Nested scroll areas causing height conflicts
  - auto_shrink setting `[false, true]` allowed vertical shrinking
- **Fix**: 
  - Removed inner scroll area from `render_terminal_output`
  - Changed auto_shrink to `[false, false]` to prevent height changes
  - Added Frame with minimum height allocation (SHELL_OUTPUT_MIN_HEIGHT)
  - Used allocate_ui_with_layout for consistent height

### 3. Search Result Modal Handler
- **Implementation**: Added `__OPEN_FILE__` action handler in `/home/adam/repos/sagitta/crates/sagitta-code/src/gui/app/rendering.rs`
- **Features**:
  - Reads file content around the search result lines
  - Extracts code snippet based on start_line and end_line
  - Adds code_snippet field to the JSON display
  - Shows enhanced search result data in JSON modal

## Testing Required

1. **Semantic Search Click Test**:
   - Run a semantic code search
   - Verify all results show (not limited to 5)
   - Click on a search result
   - Confirm JSON modal opens with code snippet

2. **Shell Output Test**:
   - Run shell commands with varying output lengths
   - Verify consistent height is maintained
   - Test streaming output (e.g., `find /` or long-running commands)
   - Confirm no shrinking occurs during streaming

## Code Quality
- All changes maintain existing code patterns
- No new dependencies added
- Consistent with egui framework usage
- Proper error handling maintained
