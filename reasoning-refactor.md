# Reasoning Engine & Streaming Architecture Refactor Plan

## Executive Summary

The current reasoning engine in `reasoning.rs` and streaming implementations in `streaming.rs` and `gemini/streaming.rs` suffer from fundamental architectural flaws that make them prone to failure and poor decision-making. This plan outlines a complete refactor into a new `reasoning-engine` crate based on modern AI reasoning patterns and robust streaming architectures, implementing a stateful graph-based execution engine with proper decision-making, backtracking, self-reflection capabilities, and reliable streaming infrastructure.

#### 2.5.1: Implement Iterative Multi-Step Tool Execution in `ReasoningEngine::process`
- **Goal**: Enhance `ReasoningEngine::process` to support iterative execution of sequential and dependent tool calls guided by the LLM.
- **Status**: **TO DO** ⚠️
- **Components & Logic**:
    - **Main Reasoning Loop**:
        - Implement a loop within `ReasoningEngine::process` that continues as long as the task is not complete and `max_iterations` (from `ReasoningConfig`) is not reached.
        - Initialize loop with the output of an initial planning step (e.g., `analyze_input` tool).
    - **LLM Interaction within Loop**:
        - At each iteration, construct the appropriate prompt/messages for the LLM, including:
            - Original user request.
            - Relevant conversation history (sequence of user, assistant, and tool messages).
            - Results from previously executed tools in the current sequence.
            - Current sub-goal or instruction for the LLM, if applicable.
        - Call the LLM (e.g., `self.llm_client.generate_stream` or a method that can return structured data like tool calls).
    - **LLM Response Parsing & Handling**:
        - Process the LLM's response (which may include streamed text and/or structured tool call requests).
        - Stream any textual part of the LLM's response immediately via the `StreamHandler` for real-time feedback.
        - **Crucially, detect and parse any structured tool call requests made by the LLM.** This requires `reasoning_engine::traits::LlmStreamChunk` and the `ReasoningLlmClientAdapter` to support conveying structured tool calls (not just text in `LlmStreamChunk.content`). The `LlmStreamChunk` might need to become an enum or carry richer parts.
    - **Tool Execution via Orchestrator**:
        - If the LLM requests one or more tools:
            - Convert LLM tool call requests into `ToolExecutionRequest` objects.
            - Invoke `self.orchestrator.orchestrate_tools(...)` to execute them.
            - Handle success and failure of tool execution, emitting appropriate events.
    - **Context Update & Continuation**:
        - Add the LLM's textual response and the results of any executed tools (both success and failure) to the conversation history / `ReasoningState` for the next iteration.
        - Determine the next input/prompt for the LLM based on the latest tool results and the overall plan/goal.
    - **Loop Termination Conditions**:
        - The loop should terminate when:
            - The LLM indicates the task is complete (e.g., by providing a final answer without requesting further tools).
            - A configurable maximum number of iterations (`ReasoningConfig.max_iterations`) is reached.
            - An unrecoverable error occurs during LLM interaction or tool execution.
            - Overall task confidence (if tracked) drops below a specified threshold.
    - **State Management**:
        - Ensure `ReasoningState` is comprehensively updated throughout the loop, reflecting the history of interactions, steps taken, tool calls made, decisions, and any errors.
    - **Configuration**:
        - The loop's behavior (max iterations, timeouts, etc.) should be controllable via `ReasoningConfig`.
- **Impact**: This will enable the `ReasoningEngine` to autonomously manage multi-step tasks that require sequential tool calls and LLM reasoning turns, fulfilling a core requirement for complex agent behavior. This directly addresses the current limitation where the engine stops after a single LLM interaction post-initial analysis.

## Crate Architecture Decision

After analysis, we created a **single `reasoning-engine` crate** that includes both reasoning and streaming infrastructure. The streaming complexity is tightly coupled to reasoning coordination and unlikely to be useful as a standalone library.

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation (Future)
**Goal**: Comprehensive testing and validation of the integrated systems

## Migration Strategy

### Direct Integration Approach
Since the reasoning-engine crate is complete and robust, we can do a **direct replacement** rather than gradual migration:

1. **Add reasoning-engine dependency** to sagitta-code Cargo.toml
2. **Implement trait adapters** for existing sagitta-code systems
3. **Replace legacy reasoning/streaming** with new engine calls
4. **Update configuration** to use new config system
5. **Remove old implementations** once integration is verified

## Benefits of This Approach

### **For the Reasoning Engine Crate:**
1. **Reusability**: Other projects can use sophisticated reasoning capabilities
2. **Independent Development**: Can evolve reasoning logic separately from agent concerns
3. **Better Testing**: Isolated testing of reasoning logic (74 tests)
4. **Clear APIs**: Forces clean separation between reasoning and agent orchestration

### **For Fred-Agent:**
1. **Simplified Codebase**: Removes complex reasoning logic from agent core
2. **Better Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
3. **Easier Testing**: Can mock reasoning engine for agent tests
4. **Performance**: Faster compilation when only agent logic changes
5. **Reliability**: Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms

### **For the Ecosystem:**
1. **Potential Open Source**: Could open-source reasoning engine separately
2. **Future Projects**: Other AI agents can leverage the reasoning framework
3. **Community**: Reasoning engine could attract external contributors
