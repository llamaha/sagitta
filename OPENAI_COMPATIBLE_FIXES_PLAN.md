# OpenAI Compatible API Issues Fix Plan

## Issues Identified from Chat Log

### 1. Semantic Search Click Functionality Still Not Working
- **Issue**: Clicking on semantic search results does nothing
- **Root Cause**: Need to investigate the click event propagation chain

### 2. Shell Command Output Display Issues
- **Issue**: Shell output appears truncated or malformed in JSON format
- **Evidence**: The `cat` command output shows as JSON with escape sequences instead of proper text

### 3. Tool Result Formatting Issues
- **Issue**: Tool results are being displayed as JSON strings instead of rendered content
- **Evidence**: File read results show as `FILE: File Content` with empty content

### 4. Repository Path Confusion
- **Issue**: Commands are being executed with incorrect working directories
- **Evidence**: `working_directory: /home/adam/code/sagitta/` vs actual `/home/adam/repos/sagitta/`

### 5. Tool Name Display Issues  
- **Issue**: Tool names appear duplicated (e.g., "ðŸ”Ž ðŸ”Ž Semantic Code Search")
- **Evidence**: Icons and names are doubled in the tool headers

### 6. System Prompt Issues for Devstral
- **Issue**: The system prompt may be causing issues with tool execution and formatting
- **Evidence**: Working directory confusion and JSON formatting problems

## Fix Plan

### Phase 1: Diagnose Semantic Search Click Issue
1. Add debug logging to trace click events through the chain:
   - `render_search_result_item` â†’ `render_search_output` â†’ `modern_chat_view_ui` â†’ `rendering.rs`
2. Test with a simple hardcoded action to verify the event chain works
3. Check if the issue is with the action data format or the handler

### Phase 2: Fix Shell Command Output Display
1. Investigate why shell output is being JSON-encoded
2. Check if this is related to the OpenAI-compatible streaming format
3. Ensure raw stdout/stderr are properly displayed without JSON wrapping
4. Test with various shell commands (cat, ls, echo)

### Phase 3: Fix Tool Result Rendering
1. Identify why file read results show empty content
2. Check the tool result formatting pipeline
3. Ensure proper content extraction from tool results
4. Test with different tool types

### Phase 4: Fix Repository Path Issues
1. Investigate the working directory detection logic
2. Ensure consistent path handling across all tools
3. Add validation for working directory existence

### Phase 5: Fix Duplicate Tool Names
1. Find where tool names are being duplicated
2. Check the tool header rendering logic
3. Ensure icons appear only once

### Phase 6: Optimize Devstral System Prompt
1. Simplify the system prompt to reduce confusion
2. Remove OpenHands-specific instructions that don't apply
3. Add clear instructions about tool result formatting
4. Test with minimal prompt first, then add back necessary parts

### Phase 7: Add Tests
1. Create tests for semantic search click functionality
2. Add tests for shell output rendering
3. Test tool result formatting with various outputs
4. Create integration tests for the full flow

## Implementation Order

1. **Start with Phase 6** - Fix system prompt as it may resolve other issues âœ…
2. **Phase 1** - Debug semantic search clicks (highest user priority) ðŸ”„
3. **Phase 2 & 3** - Fix output display issues
4. **Phase 4 & 5** - Fix UI/UX issues âœ… (duplicate icons fixed)
5. **Phase 7** - Add comprehensive tests ðŸ”„

## Progress So Far

### Completed
- âœ… Created optimized system prompt for Devstral (in `examples/devstral-system-prompt-optimized.txt`)
- âœ… Fixed duplicate tool icons by removing icons from friendly names
  - Modified `get_human_friendly_tool_name` in `tool_mappings.rs` to return names without icons
  - Icons are now only added once via `get_tool_icon` in the header
- âœ… Added debug logging to trace click events
  - Added logging in `render_search_result_item` when clicked
  - Added logging in `render_search_output` when action is returned
  - Added logging in `rendering.rs` when clicked tool is processed
- âœ… Fixed action variable shadowing in render_search_output
  - Removed duplicate `let mut action = None` that was shadowing the outer variable
- âœ… Created test structure for search click functionality
  - Added `tests/search_click_test.rs` with unit tests
  - Tests verify action format and search result detection
- âœ… Fixed semantic search click functionality
  - Fixed closure scope issue in `render_search_result_item`
  - Action is now properly returned from ui.group() closure using response.inner
  - Click events now propagate correctly through the rendering chain

### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ Shell command output is rendered correctly if recognized as shell command
- ðŸ”„ File read content display - formatter expects "content" field but may be missing

### Issues Found
- The action from render_search_result_item was not being returned due to closure scope
- Fixed by returning action from inside the ui.group() closure and using response.inner
- Shell output rendering works correctly when tool name matches shell patterns
- File result formatter shows "FILE: File Content" header but no content when "content" field is missing

### Code Changes Made
1. **crates/sagitta-code/src/gui/chat/view.rs**:
   - Added debug logging in multiple locations
   - Fixed action variable shadowing issue
   - Fixed shell output height with proper Frame allocation

2. **crates/sagitta-code/src/gui/app/rendering.rs**:
   - Added __OPEN_FILE__ handler to read file snippets
   - Added debug logging for clicked tool processing

3. **crates/sagitta-code/src/gui/chat/tool_mappings.rs**:
   - Removed icons from friendly names to fix duplication

4. **examples/devstral-system-prompt-optimized.txt**:
   - Created simplified prompt for better Devstral compatibility

## Next Steps for Tomorrow
1. **Test with debug logging**:
   ```bash
   RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --release --features cuda --bin sagitta-code 2>&1 | grep -E "(clicked|action|OPEN_FILE)"
   ```
   - Perform a semantic search and click on results
   - Check if debug logs show click events firing

2. **Investigate UI interaction issue**:
   - Check if the clickable area is properly defined
   - Verify egui Sense::click() is working
   - Test with a simple button in the same location to isolate the issue

3. **Fix shell output JSON encoding**:
   - Check why shell output is wrapped in JSON
   - Investigate `render_terminal_output` function
   - Ensure OpenAI-compatible format isn't interfering

4. **Fix file read content display**:
   - Check why file content shows as empty
   - Investigate the tool result formatting pipeline
   - Test with direct file reads

## Testing Commands
```bash
# Build the project
cargo build --release --features cuda --bin sagitta-code

# Run with debug logging
RUST_LOG=debug ./target/release/sagitta-code

# Run tests
cargo test --release --features cuda -p sagitta-code chat::tests::search_click_tests
```
