# VectorDB CLI

VectorDB CLI is a command-line client for managing indexed code repositories. It allows developers to index, search, and interact with codebase embeddings directly from the terminal.

vectordb-cli is powered by the [vectordb-core](./crates/vectordb-core/README.md) library, and they are currently packaged together in this repository. This structure facilitates rapid development during these early phases. In the future, `vectordb-core` will be migrated to a standalone library crate, suitable for use as a dependency in other projects.
