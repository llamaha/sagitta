# Git Centralization Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the centralization of git functionality from sagitta-search into a new `crates/git-manager` crate with enhanced branch management, automatic resync capabilities, and merkle tree optimization for efficient change detection.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Git Functionality Distribution

**sagitta-search (`src/`):**
- `git_helpers.rs` (4.8KB) - Branch switching, remote fetching, local merging
- `repo_helpers/git_utils.rs` (7.1KB) - SSH credentials, file collection, repository branch switching
- `sync.rs` (28KB) - Repository synchronization with git operations
- `repo_add.rs` (36KB) - Repository addition with git cloning

**sagitta-cli (`crates/sagitta-cli/`):**
- `use_branch.rs` (1.6KB) - CLI branch switching command
- Basic git operations integrated into CLI commands

**sagitta-mcp (`crates/sagitta-mcp/`):**
- `handlers/repository.rs` (63KB) - MCP git operations
- Branch-aware querying and sync operations
- No branch switching endpoints

**sagitta-code (`crates/sagitta-code/`):**
- `gui/repository/manager.rs` (55KB+) - GUI repository management
- Repository state capture and sync progress tracking
- Branch selection UI but no switching functionality

### Key Issues Identified

1. **Scattered Functionality** - Git operations spread across multiple files and crates
2. **Large File Sizes** - Several files exceed 50KB and need modularization
3. **Missing Auto-Resync** - Branch switching doesn't trigger automatic vector database resync
4. **No Change Detection** - No efficient way to detect what needs resyncing between branches
5. **Inconsistent APIs** - Different interfaces across CLI, MCP, and GUI

## Goals

### Primary Objectives
- **Centralize** all git functionality into a dedicated `git-manager` crate
- **Implement** automatic resync when switching branches
- **Add** merkle tree-based change detection for efficient incremental updates
- **Create** highly modular architecture to prevent large files
- **Ensure** seamless branch switching experience across all tools

### Secondary Objectives
- **Enhance** git operations with advanced features (worktrees, conflict resolution)
- **Improve** performance through intelligent caching and change detection
- **Standardize** git APIs across all sagitta tools
- **Add** comprehensive testing and validation

### Key Components

#### 1. Merkle Tree Implementation
```rust
pub struct BranchState {
    pub branch_name: String,
    pub commit_hash: String,
    pub merkle_root: String,
    pub file_hashes: HashMap<PathBuf, String>,
    pub last_updated: SystemTime,
}

pub struct MerkleManager {
    // Track state per repository per branch
    branch_states: HashMap<String, HashMap<String, BranchState>>,
}
```

#### 2. Enhanced Branch Operations
```rust
pub async fn switch_branch_with_resync<C>(
    client: Arc<C>,
    repo_config: &mut RepositoryConfig,
    target_branch: &str,
    app_config: &AppConfig,
) -> Result<SwitchResult>
where
    C: QdrantClientTrait + Send + Sync + 'static;
```

#### 3. Intelligent Sync Detection
```rust
pub struct SyncRequirement {
    pub sync_type: SyncType,           // None, Incremental, Full
    pub files_to_add: Vec<PathBuf>,
    pub files_to_update: Vec<PathBuf>,
    pub files_to_delete: Vec<PathBuf>,
}

pub enum SyncType {
    None,        // No sync needed - merkle roots match
    Incremental, // Only sync changed files - merkle diff available
    Full,        // Full resync needed - no previous state or force sync
}
```

#### 4. Sync Behavior Details

**Incremental Sync (Default):**
- Uses merkle tree to detect exactly which files changed
- Only processes files that are different between branches
- Prevents duplicate processing of unchanged files
- Maintains vector database consistency without redundant work

**Full Sync (When Needed):**
- First-time sync (no previous merkle state)
- Force sync option (bypass merkle tree completely)
- Corrupted merkle state recovery
- Cross-repository operations where incremental detection isn't possible

**No Sync (Optimization):**
- Merkle roots identical between current and target state
- No files have changed since last sync
- Immediate return without any vector database operations

6. **Performance** validation and tuning

## Technical Specifications

### Merkle Tree Implementation

#### Purpose:
- **Efficient Change Detection** - Quickly determine what files changed between branches
- **Incremental Sync** - Only resync files that actually changed
- **State Persistence** - Remember branch states across application restarts
- **Performance Optimization** - Avoid unnecessary vector database operations

#### Design:
```rust
// File-level hashing for change detection
pub fn calculate_file_hash(path: &Path) -> Result<String> {
    // Use SHA-256 for content hashing
    // Include file metadata (size, modified time) for quick checks
}

// Branch-level merkle root calculation
pub fn calculate_merkle_root(file_hashes: &HashMap<PathBuf, String>) -> String {
    // Combine all file hashes into a single merkle root
    // Deterministic ordering for consistent results
}

// Change detection between branches
pub fn detect_changes(from_state: &BranchState, to_state: &BranchState) -> BranchDiff {
    // Compare merkle roots first (fast path)
    // If different, compare individual file hashes
    // Return specific files that changed
}
```

### Branch Switching with Auto-Resync

#### Workflow:
1. **Validate** target branch exists
2. **Calculate** merkle diff between current and target branch
3. **Switch** git branch using git2 library
4. **Determine** sync requirements based on diff
5. **Perform** incremental or full resync as needed
6. **Update** repository configuration
7. **Persist** new branch state

#### API Design:
```rust
pub struct SwitchOptions {
    pub force: bool,                    // Force switch even with uncommitted changes
    pub auto_resync: bool,              // Automatically resync after switch (default: true)
    pub sync_options: SyncOptions,      // Options for the resync operation
}

pub struct SwitchResult {
    pub success: bool,
    pub previous_branch: String,
    pub new_branch: String,
    pub sync_result: Option<SyncResult>,
    pub files_changed: usize,
}
```

### Integration Points

#### sagitta-search Integration:
```rust
// Replace existing git_helpers.rs functionality
use git_manager::operations::switch_branch_with_resync;
use git_manager::sync::detect_sync_requirements;

// Update RepositoryConfig to include merkle state
pub struct RepositoryConfig {
    // ... existing fields ...
    pub branch_states: HashMap<String, BranchState>,
}
```

#### CLI Integration:
```rust
// crates/sagitta-cli/src/cli/repo_commands/use_branch.rs
pub async fn handle_use_branch(args: UseBranchArgs, config: &mut AppConfig) -> Result<()> {
    let switch_result = git_manager::operations::switch_branch_with_resync(
        client, repo_config, &args.name, config
    ).await?;
    
    println!("Switched to branch '{}' and resynced {} files", 
             switch_result.new_branch, switch_result.files_changed);
}
```

#### MCP Integration:
```rust
// Add new MCP endpoints
// repository/switch_branch - Switch branch with auto-resync
// repository/list_branches - List available branches
// repository/create_branch - Create new branch
// repository/branch_status - Get branch sync status
```

#### Fred-Agent Integration:
```rust
// Add branch switching UI components
// Integrate with existing sync progress tracking
// Show branch status and sync requirements
// Enable branch creation and management from GUI
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- **Core Operations** - Test each git operation in isolation
- **Merkle Logic** - Validate hash calculations and change detection
- **Error Handling** - Test error conditions and recovery
- **Edge Cases** - Handle corrupted repos, network failures, etc.

### Integration Tests
- **Real Repositories** - Test with actual git repositories
- **Branch Operations** - Validate branch switching and creation
- **Sync Operations** - Test automatic resync functionality
- **Performance** - Validate performance with large repositories

### Critical Sync Behavior Tests (Phase 4/5)
**Purpose:** Prevent duplication bugs and ensure proper incremental sync behavior

#### Incremental Sync Tests:
1. **No Duplicate Results Test**
   ```rust
   #[tokio::test]
   async fn test_repeated_sync_no_duplicates() {
       // Setup: Repository with existing vector database entries
       // Action: Run sync twice without any file changes
       // Expected: Second sync should detect no changes and process 0 files
       // Validates: Merkle tree correctly identifies unchanged state
   }
   ```

2. **Incremental Change Detection Test**
   ```rust
   #[tokio::test]
   async fn test_incremental_sync_only_changed_files() {
       // Setup: Repository with 100 files, all synced
       // Action: Modify 3 files, run sync
       // Expected: Only 3 files processed, 97 files skipped
       // Validates: Merkle tree accurately detects specific changes
   }
   ```

3. **Branch Switch Incremental Sync Test**
   ```rust
   #[tokio::test]
   async fn test_branch_switch_incremental_sync() {
       // Setup: Two branches with overlapping files
       // Action: Switch between branches multiple times
       // Expected: Only files that differ between branches are processed
       // Validates: Branch-specific merkle states prevent over-syncing
   }
   ```

#### Force Sync Tests:
4. **Force Sync Full Resync Test**
   ```rust
   #[tokio::test]
   async fn test_force_sync_resyncs_everything() {
       // Setup: Repository with all files already synced
       // Action: Run force sync (bypass merkle tree)
       // Expected: All files processed regardless of merkle state
       // Validates: Force sync option works correctly
   }
   ```

5. **Force Sync After Corruption Test**
   ```rust
   #[tokio::test]
   async fn test_force_sync_recovers_from_corruption() {
       // Setup: Repository with corrupted vector database state
       // Action: Run force sync to rebuild from scratch
       // Expected: All files reprocessed, vector database rebuilt correctly
       // Validates: Force sync can recover from inconsistent states
   }
   ```

#### State Persistence Tests:
6. **Merkle State Persistence Test**
   ```rust
   #[tokio::test]
   async fn test_merkle_state_persists_across_restarts() {
       // Setup: Sync repository, save merkle state, restart application
       // Action: Run sync again after restart
       // Expected: No files processed (state correctly restored)
       // Validates: Merkle state persistence prevents unnecessary work
   }
   ```

### Test Binary Features
```rust
// bin/git-manager-test.rs
Commands:
- switch <repo> <branch>     # Test branch switching
- merkle <repo>              # Test merkle operations
- sync <repo>                # Test sync detection
- force-sync <repo>          # Test force sync (bypass merkle)
- benchmark <repo>           # Run performance tests
- validate <repo>            # Validate repository state
```

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Merkle Calculation** - Time to calculate merkle roots
- **Change Detection** - Time to detect changes between branches
- **Branch Switching** - End-to-end branch switch performance
- **Memory Usage** - Memory consumption during operations

## Migration Strategy

### Breaking Changes Policy
Since no external users exist yet, breaking changes are acceptable to achieve the best architecture.

### Migration Steps

#### 1. CLI Migration (Lowest Risk)
- **Replace** git operations with git-manager calls
- **Add** new branch management commands
- **Test** with existing repositories and workflows
- **Validate** performance and functionality

#### 2. MCP Migration (Medium Risk)
- **Update** repository handlers to use git-manager
- **Add** new branch operation endpoints
- **Maintain** existing MCP protocol compatibility
- **Test** with MCP clients and tools

#### 3. Fred-Agent Migration (Highest Risk)
- **Update** repository manager to use git-manager
- **Add** branch switching UI components
- **Integrate** with existing sync progress tracking
- **Test** GUI functionality and user experience

### Rollback Strategy
- **Git branches** for each migration step
- **Incremental commits** for easy rollback
- **Comprehensive testing** before each step
- **Backup configurations** before migration
