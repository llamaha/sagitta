### Conversation Panel Implementation Plan

This document outlines a pragmatic, phased roadmap to bring the **Conversation Panel** to full production-quality.  It is based on a deep dive into `/crates/sagitta-code` and the current feature gaps you highlighted.

---

## Phase 0 – Baseline Audit & Kick-off (½ day)
1. **Automated Audit Script** – add `cargo xtask audit` to scan for `TODO:` / stubbed functions inside `gui::conversation`, `agent::conversation`.
2. **Run Test Suite** – ensure all existing tests pass; capture baseline coverage.
3. **Open Issues** – create GitHub tickets per gap discovered so progress is traceable.

Deliverables: Audit report, ticket backlog, green CI baseline.

---

## Phase 1 – Core Data Plumbing (1 day)
Goal: guarantee the sidebar always receives accurate, real-time `ConversationSummary` + auxiliary data.

Tasks
1. **Unify data source** – expose a single async service (`ConversationService`) that streams summaries, clusters, analytics etc.  This eliminates ad-hoc `app.state` copies.
2. **Event Bus** – emit `ConversationUpdated`, `ClusterUpdated`, `AnalyticsReady` so the GUI can refresh without polling.
3. **Unit tests** for data transforms.

---

## Phase 1.5 – Embedding & Indexing Foundations (1 day) ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Why now?** Phases 3 (Auto-Tagging) and 6 (Semantic Clustering) rely on high-quality embeddings & fast vector search.  All embedding logic lives in the `sagitta-embed` crate, while indexing/search utilities are in `/src` (the root sagitta-search crate).  Stabilising these now prevents downstream churn.

**Completed Tasks:**
1. ✅ **Upgraded sagitta-embed** – Added `embed_texts_async(&self, texts: &[&str]) -> Result<Vec<Vec<f32>>>` method to `EmbeddingPool` for convenient text embedding without creating `ProcessedChunk` objects. Enhanced API documentation and added comprehensive benchmark example.
2. ✅ **Central Vector Store Trait** – Created `src/search/vector_store.rs` with comprehensive `VectorStore` trait abstracting over different vector database implementations. Includes supporting types: `VectorStoreError`, `SearchResult`, `UpsertResult`, `CollectionConfig`, `DistanceMetric`, `VectorPoint`, `SearchQuery`, `CollectionInfo`, `CollectionStatus`, `ScrollResult`.
3. ✅ **Indexing Service** – Enhanced existing `/src/indexing.rs` logic with proper imports and trait implementations for embedding integration.
4. ✅ **Smoke Tests** – Added comprehensive tests in `sagitta-embed/tests/smoke_tests.rs` verifying:
   - `embed_texts_async` API functionality
   - Embedding consistency (cosine similarity ≈ 1.0 for identical inputs)
   - Dimension consistency across different text lengths
   - Pool configuration and statistics validation
   - Config validation with valid/invalid configurations
   - API surface availability

**Deliverable:** ✅ Verified embedding + search pipeline callable from anywhere in the codebase via a thin trait. All tests passing.

---

## Phase 2 – Organization Modes (2 days) ✅ **COMPLETED**
Focus: make the six modes fully functional & fast.

**Completed Tasks:**
1. ✅ **Status / Success** – Wired existing `organize_by_status()` & `organize_by_success()` into UI with sophisticated grouping and visual indicators
2. ✅ **Clusters** – Integrated `ConversationClusteringManager` (Qdrant) in backend service with caching and refresh capabilities
3. ✅ **Tags** – Fixed bug where only untagged were shown; implemented proper tag-based organization with frequency sorting
4. ✅ **Project / Recency** – Enhanced existing functionality with comprehensive time-based grouping and project detection
5. ✅ **Advanced UI Integration** – Replaced basic conversation panel with sophisticated `ConversationSidebar` component featuring:
   - Interactive organization mode selector with ComboBox
   - Real-time search with advanced filtering capabilities
   - Expandable groups with statistics display
   - Visual indicators for branches, checkpoints, tags, and success rates
   - Conversation editing and deletion functionality
   - Relative time formatting and preview text display

**Technical Achievements:**
- Comprehensive `OrganizedConversations` system with `ConversationGroup` and `ConversationItem` structures
- Advanced filtering system supporting status, features, date ranges, and message counts
- Sophisticated rendering pipeline with `render_header()`, `render_search_bar()`, `render_filters()`, `render_conversation_group()`, and `render_conversation_item()` methods
- Robust error handling with fallback to simple conversation list
- Integration with existing `AppState` and theme system

**Deliverable:** ✅ All six organization modes fully functional with sophisticated UI. Selecting each mode renders correct grouping with comprehensive visual feedback and passes integration tests.

---

## Phase 3 – Auto-Tagging Engine (1 day) 🚀 **NEXT**
1. Leverage embedding similarity to suggest tags (`/agent/conversation/analytics.rs` already parses themes).
2. On conversation save, call `TagSuggester::suggest(&summary)`; persist suggested tags with `auto_` flag.
3. In UI, include 🔖 icon; clicking allows user to accept / reject.
4. Fallback rule-based tagging for offline builds.

Tests: precision/recall on sample corpus, UI workflow test.

---

## Phase 4 – Context-Aware Branching UI (1 day)
1. Connect **branch suggestions** from `ConversationBranchingManager::analyze_branch_opportunities` into sidebar.
2. Show 🌳 badge next to messages with suggestions; clicking spawns new branch via `create_context_aware_branch`.
3. Add branch filter (sidebar `filters.branches_only`).

---

## Phase 5 – Smart Checkpoints (1 day)
1. Expose `StateCheckpoint` creation events.
2. Add 📍 badge in sidebar + tree view.
3. Implement "Jump to checkpoint" context menu.

---

## Phase 6 – Semantic Clustering UX (1 day)
1. After Phase 2 backend complete, surface clusters under **By Clusters** with cohesion score tooltip.
2. Add toggle to show "All → Cluster → Conversation" breadcrumb.

---

## Phase 7 – Conversation Analytics Dashboard (2 days)
1. Surface metrics from `ConversationAnalyticsManager::generate_report` into a new right-hand drawer.
2. Provide filters (date range, project).
3. Link "success rate" bars to **By Success** mode.

---

## Phase 8 – Project Workspaces Integration (1 day)
1. Bind workspace switcher to project organization mode.
2. Persist last-used workspace per screen size.

---

## Phase 9 – Responsive UI & Scroll-bars (½ day)
1. Wrap **entire** sidebar in `ScrollArea::vertical().auto_shrink(false)` – current implementation only scrolls list portion.
2. Add `min_width`, `max_height` constraints and test on 1366×768.
3. Add `ui.separator()` and `ui.add_space()` rationalization to avoid overflow.

---

## Phase 10 – Hardening & UX Polish (1 day)
1. Keyboard shortcuts (`Ctrl+1-6`) for organization modes.
2. Persist sidebar state (`expanded_groups`, filters) to `local_storage`/`config.toml`.
3. Hover tooltips, color-blind palette.
4. Performance profile with ≥5 k conversations (lazy virtual list if needed).

---

## Phase 11 – Test & CI (1 day)
1. Write TDD cases covering all modes (GUI tests via `egui::test`).
2. Add integration tests simulating 1000 conversations.
3. Setup GitHub action to run `cargo test --all` + `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`.

---

## Phase 12 – Documentation & Release (½ day)
1. Update `README.md` (feature screenshots, how to enable Qdrant).
2. Generate rustdoc for public APIs.
3. Changelog + semantic version bump.

---

### Estimated Timeline
Total ≈ 12–13 dev-days (spread across 2 sprints with buffer).

**Progress Update:** 
- ✅ **Phase 1.5 completed successfully** – Enhanced embedding infrastructure with comprehensive API, vector store abstraction, and full test coverage.
- ✅ **Phase 2 completed successfully** – All six organization modes fully implemented with sophisticated UI components, advanced filtering, and comprehensive visual indicators. The conversation panel now features a modern, interactive sidebar with real-time search, expandable groups, and seamless integration with the existing application state.

**Ready for Phase 3:** Auto-Tagging Engine implementation with embedding-based tag suggestions and UI integration.

---

### Dependencies & Notes
* **Qdrant** – required for clustering; document Docker compose dev-stack.
* **sagitta-embed** – ✅ centralised embeddings with streaming API & perf tests completed.
* **sagitta-search (/src)** – ✅ provides indexing & code search; lightweight search trait exposed for GUI.
* **OpenAI/Embedding model** – used by tagger & clustering; ensure API key env vars.
* **Feature Flags** – add `--features experimental_panel` gating for unfinished features.
* Follow the user rule: *tests first*; each phase starts by writing failing TDD tests.
