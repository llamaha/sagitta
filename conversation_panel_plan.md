### Conversation Panel Implementation Plan

This document outlines a pragmatic, phased roadmap to bring the **Conversation Panel** to full production-quality.  It is based on a deep dive into `/crates/sagitta-code` and the current feature gaps you highlighted.

---

## Phase 0 – Baseline Audit & Kick-off (½ day)
1. **Automated Audit Script** – add `cargo xtask audit` to scan for `TODO:` / stubbed functions inside `gui::conversation`, `agent::conversation`.
2. **Run Test Suite** – ensure all existing tests pass; capture baseline coverage.
3. **Open Issues** – create GitHub tickets per gap discovered so progress is traceable.

Deliverables: Audit report, ticket backlog, green CI baseline.

---

## Phase 1 – Core Data Plumbing (1 day)
Goal: guarantee the sidebar always receives accurate, real-time `ConversationSummary` + auxiliary data.

Tasks
1. **Unify data source** – expose a single async service (`ConversationService`) that streams summaries, clusters, analytics etc.  This eliminates ad-hoc `app.state` copies.
2. **Event Bus** – emit `ConversationUpdated`, `ClusterUpdated`, `AnalyticsReady` so the GUI can refresh without polling.
3. **Unit tests** for data transforms.

---

## Phase 1.5 – Embedding & Indexing Foundations (1 day) ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Why now?** Phases 3 (Auto-Tagging) and 6 (Semantic Clustering) rely on high-quality embeddings & fast vector search.  All embedding logic lives in the `sagitta-embed` crate, while indexing/search utilities are in `/src` (the root sagitta-search crate).  Stabilising these now prevents downstream churn.

**Completed Tasks:**
1. ✅ **Upgraded sagitta-embed** – Added `embed_texts_async(&self, texts: &[&str]) -> Result<Vec<Vec<f32>>>` method to `EmbeddingPool` for convenient text embedding without creating `ProcessedChunk` objects. Enhanced API documentation and added comprehensive benchmark example.
2. ✅ **Central Vector Store Trait** – Created `src/search/vector_store.rs` with comprehensive `VectorStore` trait abstracting over different vector database implementations. Includes supporting types: `VectorStoreError`, `SearchResult`, `UpsertResult`, `CollectionConfig`, `DistanceMetric`, `VectorPoint`, `SearchQuery`, `CollectionInfo`, `CollectionStatus`, `ScrollResult`.
3. ✅ **Indexing Service** – Enhanced existing `/src/indexing.rs` logic with proper imports and trait implementations for embedding integration.
4. ✅ **Smoke Tests** – Added comprehensive tests in `sagitta-embed/tests/smoke_tests.rs` verifying:
   - `embed_texts_async` API functionality
   - Embedding consistency (cosine similarity ≈ 1.0 for identical inputs)
   - Dimension consistency across different text lengths
   - Pool configuration and statistics validation
   - Config validation with valid/invalid configurations
   - API surface availability

**Deliverable:** ✅ Verified embedding + search pipeline callable from anywhere in the codebase via a thin trait. All tests passing.

---

## Phase 2 – Organization Modes (2 days) ✅ **COMPLETED**
Focus: make the six modes fully functional & fast.

**Completed Tasks:**
1. ✅ **Status / Success** – Wired existing `organize_by_status()` & `organize_by_success()` into UI with sophisticated grouping and visual indicators
2. ✅ **Clusters** – Integrated `ConversationClusteringManager` (Qdrant) in backend service with caching and refresh capabilities
3. ✅ **Tags** – Fixed bug where only untagged were shown; implemented proper tag-based organization with frequency sorting
4. ✅ **Project / Recency** – Enhanced existing functionality with comprehensive time-based grouping and project detection
5. ✅ **Advanced UI Integration** – Replaced basic conversation panel with sophisticated `ConversationSidebar` component featuring:
   - Interactive organization mode selector with ComboBox
   - Real-time search with advanced filtering capabilities
   - Expandable groups with statistics display
   - Visual indicators for branches, checkpoints, tags, and success rates
   - Conversation editing and deletion functionality
   - Relative time formatting and preview text display

**Technical Achievements:**
- Comprehensive `OrganizedConversations` system with `ConversationGroup` and `ConversationItem` structures
- Advanced filtering system supporting status, features, date ranges, and message counts
- Sophisticated rendering pipeline with `render_header()`, `render_search_bar()`, `render_filters()`, `render_conversation_group()`, and `render_conversation_item()` methods
- Robust error handling with fallback to simple conversation list
- Integration with existing `AppState` and theme system

**Deliverable:** ✅ All six organization modes fully functional with sophisticated UI. Selecting each mode renders correct grouping with comprehensive visual feedback and passes integration tests.

---

## Phase 3 – Auto-Tagging Engine (1 day) ✅ **COMPLETED**
1. ✅ Leverage embedding similarity to suggest tags (`/agent/conversation/analytics.rs` already parses themes).
2. ✅ On conversation save, call `TagSuggester::suggest(&summary)`; persist suggested tags with `auto_` flag.
3. ✅ In UI, include 🔖 icon; clicking allows user to accept / reject.
4. ✅ Fallback rule-based tagging for offline builds.

**Completed Tasks:**
- ✅ **Embedding-based Tag Suggestions** – Implemented `TagSuggester` with semantic similarity using sagitta-embed
- ✅ **Rule-based Fallback** – Comprehensive rule system for offline tagging with keyword, pattern, and project-type rules
- ✅ **UI Integration** – Complete `TagManagementUI` with accept/reject workflow, confidence indicators, and statistics
