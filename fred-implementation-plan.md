# Fred Agent Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for reimplementing the Fred Agent to use `sagitta-search` directly instead of relying on the `sagitta-mcp` server component. The new implementation will eliminate network dependencies by integrating the Gemini client directly into the agent, making it a standalone, robust AI coding agent.

## Current State Analysis

The existing `sagitta-code-old` codebase:
1. Uses a client/server architecture with `sagitta-mcp` as the server
2. Communicates with the MCP server via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
3. Relies on MCP for Gemini API integration and tool execution
4. Has faced stability issues with SSE (timeouts, connection failures)

## New Architecture Requirements

The new `sagitta-code` will:
1. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Use `sagitta-search` as a direct, in-process dependency for codebase understanding and persistent storage.
2. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Integrate the Gemini client from `sagitta-code-old/llm_handler.rs` directly, bypassing `sagitta-mcp` entirely.
3. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Replace all server-client communication with direct library calls and internal function invocations.
4. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Maintain similar functionality to the old agent while significantly improving reliability and performance.
5. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Include a comprehensive repository management UI component for direct user control and agent access to repository operations.
6. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Implement a robust Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) mechanism for sensitive operations.
7. ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED** - Include a tasks panel for managing future prompts and automation.
8. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Support containerized command execution for enhanced security and isolation.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Project Setup & Foundational Integrations

1.  **Dependencies** ✅ **COMPLETED**
    - ✅ Update `Cargo.toml` to include:
        - ✅ `sagitta_search` (direct dependency)
        - ✅ `eframe` (for eGui frontend)
        - ✅ `reqwest`, `serde`, `serde_json` (for direct Gemini API calls)
        - ✅ `tokio` (for async runtime)
        - ✅ `tracing`, `env_logger` (for logging)
        - ✅ `git2` (for direct Git operations, if not fully covered by `sagitta_search`'s repository management tools)
        - ❌ **NOT ADDED** - `bollard` or `docker-api` (for Docker integration) - *Note: Docker integration implemented using std::process::Command*
        - ✅ Other crates required for Gemini API integration and UI components.

2.  **Module Structure** ✅ **COMPLETED**
    - ✅ Create a granular modular structure:

## Current Status Summary

**Overall Progress: ~85% Complete**

- ✅ **Core Architecture**: Fully implemented and functional
- ✅ **Agent Logic**: Complete ReAct loop with streaming and tool execution
- ✅ **Tool System**: Comprehensive tool registry with most essential tools
- ✅ **UI System**: Full-featured GUI with advanced conversation management
- ✅ **Containerization**: Complete Docker-based execution environment
