# OpenAI Compatible API Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Semantic Search Click Functionality âœ…
**Problem**: Clicking on semantic search results did nothing
**Root Cause**: The action from `render_search_result_item` wasn't being properly returned due to closure scope issues
**Fix**: 
- Modified the function to return the action from inside the `ui.group()` closure
- Used `response.inner` to extract the returned value
- Click events now properly propagate through the rendering chain

### 2. Duplicate Tool Icons âœ…
**Problem**: Tool names appeared with duplicate icons (e.g., "ðŸ”Ž ðŸ”Ž Semantic Code Search")
**Root Cause**: Icons were being added both in the friendly name and in the header
**Fix**: Removed icons from `get_human_friendly_tool_name` function - icons are now only added once via `get_tool_icon`

### 3. Search Files Not Recursive âœ…
**Problem**: Pattern `*.rs` didn't find files in subdirectories
**Not a Bug**: This is the expected behavior - glob patterns work as designed
**Solution**: Use `**/*.rs` to search recursively (standard glob pattern)
**Documentation**: Should update AI prompts and user documentation to clarify this

### 4. Working Directory Resolution âœ…
**Problem**: Shell commands with `working_directory: "fibonacci-calculator/"` failed
**Root Cause**: The path was used as-is without resolution relative to repository location
**Fix**: 
- Modified `handle_shell_execute` to intelligently resolve relative paths
- First tries to resolve as repository name relative to `repositories_base_path`
- Falls back to resolving relative to current repository
- Provides clear logging about resolution
- Handles absolute paths correctly

## Issues Still Under Investigation

### 5. Stream Finishing Abruptly
**Problem**: AI responses cut off mid-task with `finish_reason: stop`
**Possible Causes**:
- Token limits in the OpenAI compatible API
- Model-specific behavior (Devstral)
- Timeout settings
**Next Steps**: Add more logging to track token usage and completion reasons

### 6. File Read Content Display
**Observation**: The file read results show properly in the chat log provided
**Status**: May not be an actual issue - needs verification with specific failing cases

## Code Changes Made

### 1. `crates/sagitta-code/src/gui/chat/view.rs`
- Fixed `render_search_result_item` to properly return actions from closure
- Added debug logging for click event tracking

### 2. `crates/sagitta-code/src/gui/chat/tool_mappings.rs`
- Removed icon emojis from friendly tool names

### 3. `crates/sagitta-mcp/src/handlers/shell_execute.rs`
- Added intelligent working directory resolution logic
- Added logging for path resolution decisions

## Recommendations

### For Users
1. Use `**/*.rs` pattern for recursive file searches, not `*.rs`
2. Working directories can be specified as:
   - Repository names (e.g., `fibonacci-calculator`)
   - Relative paths from current repository (e.g., `src/`)
   - Absolute paths

### For AI Models
1. Update system prompts to clarify glob pattern usage
2. Ensure AI understands the difference between `*.rs` and `**/*.rs`
3. Guide AI to use appropriate working directory formats

### For Future Development
1. Consider adding a dedicated "repository_shell_execute" tool that automatically resolves repository paths
2. Add better error messages when working directory resolution fails
3. Implement token tracking for OpenAI compatible providers
4. Add integration tests for all fixed functionality

## Testing Performed
- Manual testing of semantic search clicks
- Verified glob pattern behavior matches tests
- Tested working directory resolution logic
- All existing tests pass

## Next Steps
1. Monitor stream completion issues in production
2. Add comprehensive integration tests
3. Update documentation with correct usage patterns
4. Consider implementing continuation logic for cut-off responses
