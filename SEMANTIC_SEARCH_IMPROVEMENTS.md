# Semantic Search Output Improvements Plan

## **Current Issues Identified:**

### **1. Missing Information in MCP Output** ‚úÖ **PHASE 1 - COMPLETED**
- **Problem**: MCP `SearchResultItem` only includes `filePath`, `startLine`, `endLine`, `score`, `content`, and `preview`
- **Missing**: `elementType` and `language` fields that are available in the CLI formatter but not exposed via MCP
- **Impact**: Users can't see what type of code element was matched (function, class, etc.) or the programming language

### **2. Deduplication Logic Problems** 
- **Current Logic**: `crates/sagitta-search/src/search_impl.rs:390-420` only deduplicates on `file_path:start_line:end_line`
- **Problem**: This assumes each file location is indexed only once, but:
  - Same content could be indexed with different `element_type` values (e.g., a function that's also part of a class)
  - Language-specific parsers might create overlapping semantic chunks
  - The deduplication happens AFTER search, wasting computation and potentially losing better-scoring results

### **3. Chunking Strategy Issues**
- **Fallback Parser**: Creates non-overlapping 500-line chunks (`crates/code-parsers/src/fallback.rs:6`)
- **Language Parsers**: May create overlapping chunks when semantic elements span boundaries
- **Root Cause**: Each chunk should have a unique identifier, but currently only location-based deduplication exists

### **4. Output Format Inconsistencies**
- **CLI Format**: Shows `Score`, `File`, `Lines`, `Lang`, `Type` - comprehensive information
- **MCP Format**: Missing `elementType` and `language` fields
- **Preview Generation**: Done differently in CLI vs MCP handlers

## **Implementation Progress:**

### **Phase 1: Fix MCP Output Format** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED & TESTED**
1. **Add missing fields to `SearchResultItem`**: ‚úÖ
   - Add `elementType: String` field  
   - Add `language: String` field
   - Update MCP query handler to populate these fields from payload data

2. **Standardize preview generation**: ‚úÖ
   - Create shared preview generation logic
   - Ensure consistent truncation behavior across CLI and MCP

3. **Testing Validation**: ‚úÖ
   - Confirmed both `elementType` and `language` fields are populated correctly
   - Verified precise filtering with `elementType="function"` and `lang="rust"` parameters
   - Successfully demonstrated improved search precision in "Tell me how sagitta-cli works" test query

### **Phase 2: Fix Deduplication Strategy** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
1. **‚úÖ Improved runtime deduplication**:
   - Include `element_type` in deduplication key to allow same location with different element types
   - Implemented score-based deduplication to keep highest-scoring result for each unique key
   - Replaced HashSet with HashMap for more sophisticated deduplication logic
   
2. **üîÑ Future improvements (optional)**:
   - Move deduplication to indexing time for better performance
   - Use content hash + metadata for unique chunk identification during indexing

### **Phase 3: Investigate Chunking Overlaps** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
1. **‚úÖ Audit language parsers**:
   - **FOUND**: Python and JavaScript parsers create overlapping chunks (confirmed by existing test files)
   - **Rust parser**: Well-designed to prevent overlaps - uses semantic boundaries correctly
   - **Fallback parser**: Creates non-overlapping 500-line chunks correctly
   - **Issue confirmed in**: `tests/data/test_overlap_detection_comprehensive.rs` shows Python and JavaScript overlap problems

2. **‚úÖ Fixed overlap issues**:
   - **Fixed Python parser**: Now prevents function-function overlaps while allowing semantic class-method overlaps
   - **Fixed JavaScript parser**: Prevents nested function overlaps while allowing class-method overlaps  
   - **Enhanced overlap tests**: More nuanced detection that allows beneficial overlaps but prevents problematic ones
   - **Validation**: All 76 parser tests passing, including updated overlap detection tests
   - **Result**: Chunk overlap issues resolved, improving search quality and preventing duplicate results

### **Phase 4: Rich Code Intelligence Previews** ‚úÖ **PHASES 4A & 4B COMPLETED**

**Vision**: Transform semantic search results from simple text snippets into rich code intelligence previews that provide immediate codebase understanding.

**Key Innovation**: Integrate existing repo-mapper regex parsing capabilities to show function calls, return types, dependencies, and bidirectional call graphs.

#### **Sub-Phases:**

1. **Phase 4A: Enhanced Preview Generation** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
   - ‚úÖ Added rich code context extraction with function signatures and intelligent previews
   - ‚úÖ Parse function signatures, method calls, and return types for each search result
   - ‚úÖ Replace simple text previews with structured code intelligence displays
   - ‚úÖ Enhanced `CodeContextInfo` with signatures, descriptions, identifiers

2. **Phase 4B: Bidirectional Call Graph Integration** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
   - ‚úÖ Implemented comprehensive function call extraction for 6+ languages
   - ‚úÖ Added `outgoing_calls` and `incoming_calls` fields to search results
   - ‚úÖ Multi-language support: Rust, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, Java, C/C++
   - ‚úÖ Advanced pattern recognition with generic type support (`<T>`)
   - ‚úÖ TDD approach with 21 comprehensive tests

3. **Phase 4.3: Type Flow & Import Analysis**
   - Extract and display type signatures: `String ‚Üí Result<Vec<Item>, Error>`
   - Show import/dependency context for each result
   - Identify data transformation chains and patterns

4. **Phase 4.4: Pattern Recognition & Classification**
   - Detect and tag async/await patterns
   - Identify error handling approaches (Result, Option, exceptions)
   - Classify database operations, I/O patterns, and architectural patterns
   - Add semantic tags to results for better categorization

#### **Expected Transformation:**

**Before** (current):
```
"/// Formats search results for display, handling both JSON and human-readable output."
```

**After** (Phase 4 complete):
```
üîß format_search_results(results: Vec<SearchResult>, format: OutputFormat) ‚Üí Result<String, Error>
   üìû Calls: write_json, format_human_readable, truncate_preview
   üìû Called by: main, handle_query, display_results  
   üì¶ Uses: serde_json, anyhow, clap
   üè∑Ô∏è  Tags: [formatting, output, serialization, error-handling]
   üìù Formats search results for display, handling both JSON and human-readable output
```

**Benefits**: 
- Immediate code understanding with minimal additional requests
- Strong dependency graph visibility
- Pattern recognition for architectural understanding
- Rich context that accelerates development

### **Phase 5: Output Quality Improvements** üîÑ **PENDING**
1. **Add Type information prominently**:
   - Show `Type: function|class|struct|etc.` in human-readable output
   - Consider color-coding different element types

2. **Improve relevance display**:
   - Show context about why this result matched
   - Better formatting for different element types

## **Specific Files Modified:**
- ‚úÖ `crates/sagitta-mcp/src/mcp/types.rs` - Added elementType, language fields + CodeContextInfo structure (Phases 1 & 4A)
- ‚úÖ `crates/sagitta-mcp/src/handlers/query.rs` - Updated to populate new fields + intelligent preview generation (Phases 1 & 4A)
- ‚úÖ `crates/sagitta-mcp/src/code_intelligence.rs` - NEW: Rich code context extraction and intelligent previews (Phase 4A)

- ‚úÖ `crates/code-parsers/src/*.rs` - Fixed overlapping chunks in Python & JavaScript parsers (Phase 3)
- ‚úÖ `crates/sagitta-mcp/Cargo.toml` - Added regex dependency for pattern matching (Phase 4A)

## **Testing & Validation:**
- ‚úÖ MCP tests pass (84 tests passed, 0 failed)
- ‚úÖ Full compilation successful
- ‚úÖ Git commit created: `0df3bb2` 
- ‚úÖ Repository synced with updated indexing

## **Next Steps:**

- üÜï **Phase 4B**: Future - Advanced repo-mapper integration for call graphs & type flow
- üîÑ **Phase 5**: Output quality improvements (enhanced with Phase 4A context)

## **Expected User Impact:**
After restart, MCP search results will include:
- `elementType`: Shows code construct type (function, class, struct, etc.)
- `language`: Shows programming language (rust, python, javascript, etc.)
- `preview`: Intelligent code previews showing function signatures or meaningful lines
- `context_info`: Rich metadata with signatures, parent classes, descriptions, identifiers
This provides comprehensive code intelligence and context for enhanced developer productivity.
